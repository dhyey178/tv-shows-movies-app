## Backend Service (NestJS API)

This backend service, built with **NestJS**, provides the API endpoints for the TV Shows & Movies App. It is responsible for:

* Serving paginated lists of movies and TV shows, including their latest reviews.
* Providing detailed views for individual movies and TV shows, along with paginated comments.
* Handling creation of new movies, TV shows, and comments.
* Performing data validation and managing the database schema (SQLite via Prisma).
* Exposing an interactive API documentation via Swagger.

## Technologies Used

* **Framework**: [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/)
* **Database**: SQLite
* **ORM**: [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)
* **API Documentation**: [Swagger](https://swagger.io/)
* **Language**: TypeScript

## Endpoints Overview

Here's a summary of the main API endpoints served by this backend:

### Movies

* **`GET /movies`**: Get a paginated list of movies with their latest 5 comments.
* **`POST /movies`**: Create a new movie.
* **`GET /movies/{id}`**: Get a single movie by ID with its latest 5 comments.
* **`GET /movies/{id}/comments`**: Get paginated comments for a specific movie.

### TV Shows

* **`GET /tv-shows`**: Get a paginated list of TV shows with their latest 5 comments.
* **`POST /tv-shows`**: Create a new TV show.
* **`GET /tv-shows/{id}`**: Get a single TV show by ID with its latest 5 comments.
* **`GET /tv-shows/{id}/comments`**: Get paginated comments for a specific TV show.

### Comments

* **`POST /comments`**: Create a new comment for a movie or TV show.

*(Note: APIs for creating movies, TV shows, and adding comments are currently exposed via the API but do not have a direct frontend UI. You can test these functionalities using tools like Postman or through the Swagger UI.)*

## Local Setup

**Important:** For overall monorepo setup, please refer to the main `README.md` in the project root. The following steps are specific to running and managing the backend in isolation.

### Prerequisites

* Node.js v20
* pnpm v10

### Installation

If you are only working on the backend or need to install its dependencies specifically:

* Install Dependencies
```bash
pnpm install
```

* Create env or copy `.env.example`
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

* Initialize Database
```bash
pnpm db:init
```

* Seed Database
``` bash
pnpm prisma:seed
```

* Start Backend 
``` bash
pnpm start:dev
```

### API Documentation (Swagger)
Once the backend service is running, you can access the interactive Swagger UI at:
`http://localhost:4200/api`
This interface allows you to explore the available API endpoints and test them directly in your browser.


### Testing
```bash
pnpm test
```

### Database Management

The backend uses SQLite as its database, managed by Prisma.

* **Database File Location:** Your local database file is located at `prisma/prisma/dev.db` (path configurable through `.env`). This file is ignored by Git and should not be committed.

* **Prisma Schema:** The database schema is defined in `prisma/schema.prisma`.

* **Migrations:** Database migrations are located in `prisma/migrations/`.
